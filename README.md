Optimizing ReactJs Projects with the Integration of Typescript extensions using React Query.




React.js is an open-source front-end JavaScript library. React facilitates web application development to build responsive and interactive UIs for our projects, which will be efficiently updated with data modifications to render the elements into a single root DOM node. Nowadays, frontend developers are migrating to build react applications with Typescript because its code is more reliable and easier to rearrange by avoiding errors. But since we have been used to ReactJs for a long time, it may be a little unfamiliar to fully migrate our existing ReactJs project to a ReactTs project at once.
However, have you ever felt the need to integrate Typescript files for your React JavaScript-based project without fully migrating from ReactJs? In practice, it may be somewhat complicated for you to imagine that task without a proper approach. In this article, I will guide you to integrate React typescript extensions to develop your React js project with an easy method. Then You will be able to customize your react frontend web application in the combination of Js and Ts.
